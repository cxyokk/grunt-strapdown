# grunt-strapdown

> grunt task for strapdown.js

## What Is This
This [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task does a very stupid thing: it takes a set of markdown files and **inserts** each of them into a html template, where [strapdown.js][strapdown.github] takes care of all the rest (the parsing and the styling).

For example, this markdown file `xxx.md`:
```markdown
# I Am So Hungry
I am so hungry i can eat an elephant.
```
will be converted into a `xxx.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>a</title>
<body>
<xmp theme="cyborg" style="display:none;">
# I Am So Hungry
I am so hungry i can eat an elephant.
</xmp>
<script src="http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
*(Something looks different about that `</xmp>` closing tag, see FAQ below.)*

Drop this `xxx.html` into any static web server and open it from the browser, and [strapdown.js][strapdown.github] will parse and style the markdown text for you.

## Getting Started
Install this plugin:
```shell
npm install --save-dev grunt-markdown
```
Then enable it in your Gruntfile:
```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-strapdown');
```

## Running Strapdown Task
Here's an example config in coffeescript:
```coffeescript
grunt.initConfig
  strapdown:
    all:
      src: ['src/**/*.md']
      dest: 'htdocs'
      theme: 'cyborg'
```
You can run this task with `grunt strapdown`.

### Options
Follow the example config above, these are the options that the `strapdown` task accepts:

* `src`: required, pattern(s) to match markdown files.
* `dest`: required, the **directory** where generated html files will be stored in.
* `theme`: optional, defaults to 'cyborg'. See [here](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown/tree/gh-pages/v/0.2/themes) for strapdown's bulitin themes and see [bootswatch][bootswatch] for more.

## FAQ
1.  **So what my markdown file didn't get parsed, it's just inserted right into the middle of a html template?**

    Yes.

2.  **And then when I open the html from the browser, that `<script src="http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js">` tag is gonna get downloaded, and it's gonna do the parsing and styling for me?**

    Yes.

3.  **So i have to download a js file from somewhere else, that sounds weird and slow, why can't i just host that js file on my own server?**

    You can, but it's a little bit more complicated, **because strapdown.js is not just *a* js file**. In order to parse and style the markdown text, this js file will dynamiclly load some other js/css files from [strapdownjs.com][strapdown.com]. So you can't just host that single js file, you need to host all those other js/css files on your server, e.g. you need to clone this repo [github.com/arturadib/strapdown][strapdown.github].

    *(And also in this version the template path is not yet configurable.)*

4.  **Oh, what about `</xmp>` tag in the example? That 'x' looks different.**

    It's not the letter 'x', it's the multiplication sign 'Ã—'([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign)). Quote from [strapdown.js][strapdown.github]:

      > Limitations:

      > It's an unlikely scenario, but since Strapdown uses the `<xmp>` tag to wrap your Markdown (so that users don't have to escape special HTML characters), your text can't contain the string `</xmp>`.

    That's why the 'x's are replaced by grunt-strapdown before the insertion into html.

5.  **What's your favorite number?**

    42.
